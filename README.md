# nedis

The tiniest, worst language. Written in Racket.

## running tests

You can test the lexer!

```sh
cd nedis
racket lexer-test.rkt
```

## formatting

We found that one way to nicely format our files was
by using [vim-racket](https://github.com/wlangstroth/vim-racket).  We installed [pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) and ran `:wq` on each file that we wanted to format.
